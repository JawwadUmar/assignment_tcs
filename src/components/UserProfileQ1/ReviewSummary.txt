Final Review Summary

Bugs: Missing userId dependency in useEffect. State typing too loose.

Readability/Maintainability: Use proper types, handle loading/error explicitly, extract fetch logic.

Performance: Add cleanup (AbortController).

Security: Use environment variables instead of hardcoding the api urls

Unit Tests: Expand to cover success, error, and prop changes. Mock fetch.
