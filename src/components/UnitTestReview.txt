Positives:
1. It does tests the initial "Loading state" properly

Issues and Improvements:
1. Coverage
The Coverage is not 100%. It misses tests for:
    Succssful fetch
    Failed fetch
    Re-render when the userId changes

Mock fetch and test it for the different outcomes.
Make sure to add cleanUp between tests as it can lead to leaking of mocks. [afterEach(()=>jest.clearAllMocks());]
